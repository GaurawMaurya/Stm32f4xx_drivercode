# **STM32F4 Bare-Metal Driver for RCC and GPIO**

This repository contains a bare-metal driver implementation for the STM32F4 development board, focusing on:

#### RCC (Reset and Clock Control): Configuring system and peripheral clocks.
#### GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output): Controlling digital input/output operations.
#### Alternate GPIO Functions: Configuring GPIO pins for peripheral functions (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C).

This project is designed for low-level embedded development without using HAL or CMSIS, providing a deeper understanding of the STM32F4 architecture.

Features:

✅ RCC configuration for enabling peripheral clocks.

✅ GPIO initialization and control (input, output, pull-up/down, speed settings).

✅ Alternate function configuration for interfacing with peripherals.

✅ Written in C with a focus on efficiency and readability.

Target Hardware
Microcontroller: STM32F4 series
Development Board: STM32F407 Discovery
